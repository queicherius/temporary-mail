# Providers

These are the providers we tried to use as a backend API for end to end testing emails and our experiences with them:

## Meh

- [**temp-mail.org**](https://temp-mail.org/): Only offers a public API after signing up, at max 100 requests per day.

## Failures

- [**10minutemail.com**](http://10minutemail.com/): Does only allow generating 10 unique email addresses per hour.
- [**temp-mail.ru**](https://temp-mail.ru/): Emails to the domains get bounced, no emails ever deliver.
- [**guerrillamail.com**](https://www.guerrillamail.com/): Offline.
